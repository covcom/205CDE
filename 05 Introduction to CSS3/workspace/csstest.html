    <h1>1980's Home Computers</h1>
    <p>In early 1980's, home computers became mainstream. For the first time, computers could be
        purchased by an average family household.</p>

    <h2>Novel uses</h2>
    <p>The main usage for a home computer was, of course, games. As cool games may not be a valid reason for purchasing an expensive gadget,
    a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those family members who might otherwise be sceptical.
    </p>
    <p>Some reasons often mentioned were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>learning to write computer programs</li>
        <li>managing family finances</li>
        <li>keeping track of freezer contents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While some of these use cases are perfectly valid, it is still unclear how many families actually used
    their brand new home computer (duly equipped with a cassette drive) to actually record every food item they removed from the freezer.</p>
    
    <h2>Legendary computers</h2>
    <p>The three most memorizable  1980's home computers, in subjective order of importance, might be:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Commodore 64</li>
        <li>Sinclair ZX Spectrum</li>
        <li>Commodore Vic-20</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key concepts</h2>
    The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities, CPU, and amount of memory. The types of memory were:
    <dl>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default consumed a part of this.</dd>

        <dt>ROM</dt>
        <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
